**BYLAWS OF THE FEDERATION OF CHRISTIAN MINISTRIES**

# **Article 1: Membership** {#article-1:-membership}

## **Section 1: Individual Membership** {#section-1:-individual-membership}

1. An individual becomes a member by submitting a signed statement of intent to subscribe to the purposes of the Federation and submitting annual dues, which the Vice President(s) may reduce or eliminate at the Vice President(s)’s discretion. FCM denies no one membership for inability to pay dues; anyone who subscribes to the purposes of the Federation is encouraged to join. After joining, the Membership Coordinator(s) send(s) the new member identification as a member of the Federation in good standing entitled to the rights and privileges of membership. Submission of an annual report and payment of dues maintains membership.  
2. Entitlements  
   1. Individual members are entitled to ask for and expect from each other support and encouragement in their ministry. Members are entitled to be candidates for elective office, to nominate Vice Presidential candidates for their Region, for President(s), for Chairperson(s) and for Representative(s) at Large. All Members at the time election ballots are distributed may vote for candidates for Vice President(s) of their Region and for President(s) and Chairperson(s) and for Representative(s) at Large. Members are also entitled to attend Regional meetings and meetings of the Circle of Directors and to propose policy initiatives to the Circle of Directors through the Chairperson(s), including changes to the Constitution or the By-Laws. Members will receive a copy of the Constitution, By-Laws, FCM Newsletter, and all other publications of the Federation of Christian Ministries. The Circle will inform a member who submits a policy proposal of the Circle’s decision. The member will receive a written statement containing a statement of the rationale for the decision unless the member attended the meeting of the Circle when the decision was made.  
   2. Individual members may avail themselves of the Programs and Services of FCM. The Programs include the Commissioning Program, and the Endorsement Program, and other programs specified by the Circle of Directors. The Services include the FCM Newsletter, the FCM Website with Ministry Listings, Regional Networking and support, the National Assembly, Prayer Support, the National Directory of Members, the National Registry for baptisms, marriages, and holy unions, the Central Office for membership services, and organizational partnerships.  
3. Members can nominate candidates for Circle positions and vote in the election of said candidates. Members receive general information about the work and ministries of FCM through its publication, FCM Newsletter.  
4. The Circle of Directors may commission members of the Federation as legally constituted ministers under the laws of the United States of America with all due powers as granted by federal, local, and state laws and this Federation. Each commissioned member is responsible to comply with state and local laws.  
5. The Circle administers a Commissioning Program to which all members may apply. Commissioning is the recognition of the inner call of a member of FCM or the call from a community of believers for a member to function in public ministry. A commission is an ordination and an affirmation by FCM that the person meets the criteria of the Federation. The Circle of Directors establishes the criteria for commissioning and describes the criteria and process in its Commissioning Polity Manual. A commissioned member is eligible for Endorsement. The criteria and process of Endorsement are described in the Endorsement Polity Manual.  
6. Once the Circle has approved the commission, a Commissioning Ceremony would be held as a visible expression of the applicant’s new commission. In addition, the Membership Coordinator(s) will issue a certificate of ministry. Commissioning grants the authority, called “faculties,” to minister in the name of FCM. Faculties are valid initially for the current calendar year and are renewable annually based on receipt of an annual ministry report and receipt of annual renewal fees. FCM denies no one membership or commissioning for inability to pay renewal fees. The final decision to commission and to continue commissioning is the responsibility of the Circle of Directors. Liability insurance is the responsibility of the commissioned member.  
7.  A person ceases to be a member of the Federation by conduct showing that he or she no longer subscribes to the ideals of the Federation. The Executive Committee makes the judgment that a member’s behavior violates membership requirements. In exceptional circumstances, the President and one other member of the Executive Committee, or if the President is unavailable, the Chair and one other member of the Executive Committee can act.  
8. The annual report required for continued granting of faculities is to be fully completed by the member.  
9. A commissioned FCM member loses faculties to engage in any form of pastoral ministry in the name of the Federation if he or she fails to submit a complete annual report or by failure to submit annual renewal fees. Vice Presidents can waive renewal fees for a just cause. A commissioned member loses faculties to engage in pastoral ministry in the name of FCM by his or her failure to maintain FCM membership.  
   1. If a member fails to submit an annual report or pay sufficient dues by the due date (January 1, or as determined by the Circle), the Vice President, seeking to motivate renewal, is to notify the member of potential loss of membership and/or faculties (the authorization to engage in any form of pastoral ministry in the name of FCM) . The member is fully reinstated as soon as she or he complies with the requirements, subject to reinstatement rules expressed in the Commissioning Polity Manual.  
   2. If anyone’s renewal of membership or faculties is denied or they are revoked for cause other than failure to submit renewal requirements, that person and the Circle of Directors must be notified immediately in writing. The member may appeal in writing to the Circle of Directors, whose judgment will be final. During the time of the appeal, the membership/commission is considered suspended. If the regular meeting of the Circle of Directors will not be held in a reasonable time, the Chair can poll the Circle by mail, by e-mail or by telephone to decide upon the appeal.

## **Section 2: Faith Community Members, including Churches and Service Organizations** {#section-2:-faith-community-members,-including-churches-and-service-organizations}

1. A Faith Community becomes a member by its leadership submitting a signed application including a statement of intent to subscribe to the purposes of the Federation and submitting annual dues. On the application is designated a person called the Liaison, who is responsible to carry out all actions for the Faith Community with FCM. It is desirable but not necessary that the Liaison be a member of FCM. After a Faith Community has joined, the Membership Coordinator(s) send(s) the new Faith Community member identification as a Faith Community member of the Federation in good standing, entitled to the rights and privileges of Faith Community membership. Submission of a Faith Community Annual Report of activities and payment of dues maintains membership.  
2. Entitlements:  
   1. If an individual member of FCM, the Liaison is entitled to be a candidate for and to hold elective office, to nominate vice-presidential candidates for their region, for President(s), for Chairperson(s) and for Representative(s) at Large. A Liaison may vote for candidates for Vice President(s) of their Region and for President(s), Chairperson(s) and Representative(s) at Large. The Liaison casts votes in elections on the basis of one vote for the Faith Community member and its first 50 members, and one additional vote for every 50 members of the Faith Community member beyond the first 50\. There is a cap of 3 votes per Faith Community no matter how large the Faith Community. In addition, if an individual member of FCM, the Liaison casts a personal vote. These votes may be cast for one candidate or apportioned to several candidates. The Liaison is also entitled to attend Regional meetings and meetings of the Circle of Directors and to propose policy initiatives to the Circle of Directors through the Chairperson(s), including changes to the Constitution or the Bylaws. The Liaison will receive a copy of the Constitution, By Laws, FCM Newsletter, and all other publications of the Federation of Christian Ministries. The Circle will inform the Liaison of a Faith Community member who submits a policy proposal of the Circle’s decision. The Liaison will receive a written statement containing a statement of the rationale for the decision, unless the Liaison attended the meeting of the Circle when the decision was made.  
   2. While the Commissioning Program and the Endorsement Program require that participants be individual members of FCM, a Faith Community’s individual members may avail themselves of many of the other Programs and Services of FCM. Programs are specified by the Circle. The Services include the FCM Newsletter, the FCM Website, Regional Networking and support, the National Assembly, Prayer Support, the National Directory of Members, the National Registry for baptisms, marriages, and holy unions, the Central Office for membership services, and organizational partnerships. In addition, those individual members of Faith Community Members who are also Individual Members of FCM carry all the entitlements of Individual Members as listed above in Section 1, B, 1\.  
   3. FCM strongly recommends that Faith Community Members develop and implement a “safe church” policy.  
3. Loss of Faith Community Membership  
   1. A Faith Community ceases to be a member of the Federation by failing to submit an annual report or appropriate dues, or by showing that it no longer subscribes to the ideals of the Federation. The Executive Committee makes the judgment that a Faith Community Member’s behavior violates membership requirements. In exceptional circumstances, the President and one other member of the Executive Committee, or if the President is unavailable, the Chair and one other member of the Executive Committee can act.  
   2. A Faith Community Member will submit an annual report to the Membership Coordinator(s). If a Faith Community Member fails to submit an annual report or pay sufficient dues by the due date (January 1, or as determined by the Circle), the Vice President is to notify the Member of potential loss of membership. The member is fully reinstated as soon as it complies with the requirements.  
   3. If a Faith Community Member’s membership is scrutinized for denial or revocation for cause other than failure to submit renewal requirements, the President of FCM will speak with the Liaison and the Faith Community Member leader about the problem. In case that discussion fails to resolve the problem, that Faith Community Member and the Circle of Directors must be notified in writing. The Faith Community Member may present a written explanation to the Executive Committee. If this explanation does not resolve the issue, the Faith Community Member and the Circle must be informed in writing of the decision of the Executive Committee. The continuation of the Faith Community member’s membership may be appealed to the Circle of Directors, whose judgment will be final. During the time of the appeal, the membership/commission is considered suspended. If a regular meeting of the Circle of Directors will not be held in a reasonable time, the Chairperson can poll the Circle by mail, by e-mail or by telephone to decide upon the appeal.
